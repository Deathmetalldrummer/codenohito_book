- [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)
  by WHATWG (The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group)

    The WHATWG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation,
    and Opera Software in 2004, after a W3C workshop. Apple, Mozilla and Opera
    were becoming increasingly concerned about the W3C’s direction with XHTML,
    lack of interest in HTML and apparent disregard for the needs of real-world
    authors. So, in response, these organisations set out with a mission
    to address these concerns and the Web Hypertext Application Technology
    Working Group was born.
