Search Engine Optimisation analysis
===================================

https://www.google.com/webmasters



About SEO.
I made a short analysis.

Please read seo_analysis_report.pdf first. I selected the most important recommendation and made estimation for them.
I also attached file seoptimer_homepage.pdf as example of automatical analysis result.

During analysis process I've fixed one problem — make redirect from xxxxxxxxx.com to www.xxxxxxxxx.com. This is very important for SEO.

Also I registered the site in Google Webmaster. It's important to give you access to GW. Do you have Google account? Send me your email and I will add you.

Analysis result:

1. We need to improve page speed. Google make site rating lower if speed isn't good. Look at page https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=en&utm_source=wmx&utm_campaign=wmx_otherlinks&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xxxxxxxxx.com%2F&tab=desktop. I can fix the biggest part of found issues. I don't know how much time it takes but I think it will be 2 hours.

2. We can improve user expirience ans SEO with adding search appearance tags. Look at this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-kX0Aut-18 .  I think the most important snippet for us it's https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/events . 1–2 hours to add it.

3. You can improve SEO results by adding https to xxxxxxxxx.com. You need to buy SSL-sertifacate for your domain and I can add it on server. It is 1 hour of my work.
